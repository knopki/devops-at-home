# devops@home

Personal NixOS configuration management system using Nix flakes for multiple
machines with modular architecture, encrypted secrets, and development
environments.

The Home Manager is no longer used for managing dotfiles.
Instead, all dotfiles are managed by `chezmoi` in a
[separate repository](https://github.com/knopki/dotfiles).

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive NixOS configuration system that manages:

- **Multiple Hosts**: Laptops, development VM, and installation media
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable modules, profiles, and mixins
- **Secrets Management**: SOPS with age encryption for secure configuration
- **Development Environments**: Project-specific shells with integrated tooling
- **Storage Systems**: ZFS and Btrfs with encryption and snapshots
- **Container Support**: Podman with development containers
- **Outdated Documentation**: But even it is generated by AI
